## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I am new to using Xcode so first learning how the IDE is layed out and organized took me some time to understand. 

Favorite Applications:
1. WhatsApp
   - ability to message people around the world via WiFi 
   - gif stickers used to personlize chats
2. Instagram
   - sharing pictures and videos as a 24 hour story
   - sharing content as a direct message to friends
3. Notion
   - customizable interface to organize ideas, documents, notes, etc.
   - ability to write coding notes in any programming language
4. TikTok
   - personalized feed of content related to my interests
   - ability to shop online and see video reviews of products

   Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app.
   Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea,
   but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

   I love music but most of all I love sharing my music with my friends. Normally if I find a song on Apple Music or Spotify
   I would just share the link as a text message; I would love to come up with a social media app meant for sharing music. This app
   woulld allow users to have a profile similar to that of Instagram or Facebook. In this profile, the user has a bio, profile pic, and
   top three genres based on streaming history. Artists could also have accounts on this app where they can share updates to their
   musical careers with their fans. People can share music, rate from 1 to 5 stars, leave comments and even collaborate on playlists. This
   would be a great way to disocver new music amongst listeners and local communities could also promote live music events or concerts
   based on search history, streaming history, sharing history, etc.
